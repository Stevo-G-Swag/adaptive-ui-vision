# Adaptive UI Generator Roadmap

1. Implement WebSocket reconnection logic ✅
   "Enhance the WebSocket connection to include a reconnection mechanism with exponential backoff. Handle connection errors gracefully and provide user feedback."

2. Add error handling and user feedback ✅
   "Implement comprehensive error handling throughout the application. Use the toast system to provide clear feedback to users about connection status, errors, and successful actions."

3. Implement speech-to-text functionality ✅
   "Integrate a speech-to-text library or API to allow users to input messages via voice. Update the UI to include a microphone button and handle the conversion of speech to text."

4. Create a log viewer component ✅
   "Develop a new LogViewer component that displays detailed logs of the conversation, including timestamps, message types, and any errors. Integrate this component into the main UI."

5. Optimize performance and reduce component size ✅
   "Refactor the AdaptiveUIGenerator and Settings components to improve performance and reduce their size. Consider breaking them down into smaller, more manageable subcomponents."

6. Implement real-time UI updates based on AI responses ✅
   "Enhance the UI to dynamically update based on AI responses. This could include creating new UI elements, modifying existing ones, or changing styles in real-time as per AI instructions."

7. Add user authentication and session management ✅
   "Implement a user authentication system using JWT or similar technology. Create login/signup forms and manage user sessions throughout the application."

8. Implement file management system for AI-generated code
   "Create a file management system that allows the AI to create, edit, and delete files. Implement a file explorer UI for users to navigate and interact with these files."

9. Create a testing suite for the application
   "Develop a comprehensive testing suite using a testing framework like Jest. Write unit tests for individual components and integration tests for the overall application functionality."

10. Implement a caching system for faster response times
    "Design and implement a caching system to store frequently accessed data or AI responses. This should improve response times and reduce unnecessary API calls."

11. Enhance accessibility and internationalization
    "Improve the application's accessibility features and add support for multiple languages to make it more inclusive and widely usable."

12. Implement advanced AI model selection and fine-tuning
    "Add the ability for users to select different AI models and fine-tune them for specific tasks or domains."

13. Create a collaborative editing feature
    "Implement real-time collaborative editing functionality, allowing multiple users to work on the same project simultaneously."

14. Develop a plugin system for extensibility
    "Design and implement a plugin architecture that allows users to extend the functionality of the application with custom modules or integrations."

15. Implement version control for generated code
    "Add a version control system for AI-generated code, allowing users to track changes, revert to previous versions, and manage different branches of development."

16. Create a deployment pipeline for generated applications
    "Develop a system that allows users to easily deploy their AI-generated applications to various cloud platforms or hosting services."

17. Implement advanced analytics and performance monitoring
    "Add detailed analytics and performance monitoring tools to help users understand how their AI-generated applications are performing and identify areas for improvement."

18. Create a marketplace for AI-generated components and templates
    "Develop a marketplace where users can share and sell their AI-generated components, templates, and entire applications."

19. Implement AI-assisted code review and optimization
    "Create a feature that uses AI to review generated code, suggest optimizations, and automatically refactor for better performance and maintainability."

20. Develop a comprehensive documentation and learning system
    "Create an integrated documentation and learning system that helps users understand how to use the platform effectively and learn about AI-assisted development best practices."
