1. Implement WebSocket reconnection logic:
   "Enhance the WebSocket connection in AdaptiveUIGenerator.tsx to include a reconnection mechanism with exponential backoff. Handle connection errors gracefully and provide user feedback."

2. Add error handling and user feedback:
   "Implement comprehensive error handling throughout the application. Use the toast system to provide clear feedback to users about connection status, errors, and successful actions."

3. Implement speech-to-text functionality:
   "Integrate a speech-to-text library or API to allow users to input messages via voice. Update the UI to include a microphone button and handle the conversion of speech to text."

4. Create a log viewer component:
   "Develop a new LogViewer component that displays detailed logs of the conversation, including timestamps, message types, and any errors. Integrate this component into the main UI."

5. Optimize performance and reduce component size:
   "Refactor the AdaptiveUIGenerator and Settings components to improve performance and reduce their size. Consider breaking them down into smaller, more manageable subcomponents."

6. Implement real-time UI updates based on AI responses:
   "Enhance the UI to dynamically update based on AI responses. This could include creating new UI elements, modifying existing ones, or changing styles in real-time as per AI instructions."

7. Add user authentication and session management:
   "Implement a user authentication system using JWT or similar technology. Create login/signup forms and manage user sessions throughout the application."

8. Implement file management system for AI-generated code:
   "Create a file management system that allows the AI to create, edit, and delete files. Implement a file explorer UI for users to navigate and interact with these files."

9. Create a testing suite for the application:
   "Develop a comprehensive testing suite using a testing framework like Jest. Write unit tests for individual components and integration tests for the overall application functionality."

10. Implement a caching system for faster response times:
    "Design and implement a caching system to store frequently accessed data or AI responses. This should improve response times and reduce unnecessary API calls."
